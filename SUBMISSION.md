# Submission Summary

## Track Chosen
<!-- Mark your choice with [x] -->
- [x] Backend Only
- [ ] Frontend Only
- [ ] Full-Stack (Both)

## GitHub Copilot Usage Summary
<!-- Describe how you used AI throughout the test. Be specific about when and how you leveraged AI tools. -->

I provided prompt to create crud apis for task management by analysing current project structure. I also provided prompt to create user input validation and error handling.
Aksed to create model file separately in models folder.

## Key Prompts Used
<!-- List 3-5 important prompts you used with your AI assistant -->

1. mplement taks management apis with crud operation where appropriate validation and  error handling required.
This api will store data in-memory instead of any database. Must needs to validate input
2. implement pagination for get tasks api
3. input validation should be as middleware instead of inside controller.
4. integrate Integrate a third-party request logging package winston and add appropriate error or debug or info logs
5. add one more column named priority which has value like high, low and medium

## Design Decisions (optional)
<!-- Explain key architectural or implementation decisions you made and why -->

- **Decision 1:** [e.g., "Used a singleton service for in-memory task storage"]
  - **Reasoning:** [e.g., "To maintain state consistency across API calls without a database"]

- **Decision 2:** [e.g., "Implemented reactive forms instead of template-driven"]
  - **Reasoning:** [e.g., "Better type safety and validation control"]

- **Decision 3:** 
  - **Reasoning:**
